            <h2>About the Index</h2>
            <p>The Valleystreet Crypto EWI v1.0, launched in June 2022, was birthed from a desire to simplify investment analysis in the crypto market. Observing that while losses are capped, gains have no theoretical limit, the index takes a "market mindset" to investment. This mindset prompted a query: What would be the outcome of investing an equal amount across all crypto tokens at a given time and later assessing the cumulative gains or losses? Backtesting showed that such an approach, uncomplicated by rebalancing or other strategies, could be a long-term winner. The index, therefore, aims to represent the crypto market's overall health by including a diverse range of tokens, ensuring simplicity and trackability. Tokens are evaluated based on criteria such as exchange listing, market capitalization, trading data consistency, and volatility limits. The objective is to offer a comprehensive, yet straightforward, tool to gauge and navigate the crypto market's trajectory.</p>
